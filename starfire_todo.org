* Next To Do
** 1. Remove tick1 tick2 and existing time-out code
** 2. Fix indent.
** 3. Test display code
** 4. Figure out if tests works (LBUT / RBUT on start)
** 5. Look at before main loop starts (beginning on main())
** 6. Look at proper running code
** 7. Figure out rest of wall follower code
** 8. Look at sensor code
** 9. Test on track
** 10. Fix wobble
** 11. Look at wall follower
** Switch display controls optionally to BT serial view
*** DONE Program serial terminal changes
*** Test display control changes
*** Any modification required?
** Get all sensors working
*** What sensors are displayed?
*** Add in extra sensor code
*** Test all sensors
* Future To Do
** slips on back under of mouse
** Test motors
** Test EEPROM
** Test battery
** Check delays with delay variable (volatile required for optimisation?)
** test LEDs
** Program Modes
How do button A, button B, sensors and 3 LEDs interoperate?
*** Wall follower mode
*** Mouse Test mode
- Sensor test read mode?
- motor test read mode?
- battery read mode?
*** Maze solver mode
* Done
